I'm following a #youtube #video from #NetworkChuck where he focuses on building a blog in a unique way using code. Something I definitely can get behind as I need to really start documenting my journey as I learn to code and just document what I know as this will eventually be a large part of my main website wesleyfranks.com. Where you will in the future be able to go there and just search for skills and it will pull up posts and videos or posts with videos or videos as posts. I don't know how I'm going to do it just yet. Today I'm just starting, You^2 if ya know, ya know. 

*Forewarning I will say I'm going to do things and then get distracted. I used to be so hard on myself about this but I won't be anymore. This is just who I am. I get distracted and I lose track of what I'm doing but I will do as much as I can to create the necessary habits like I did for my email and finance in the morning. I did that for 30-60 days straight every morning and that helped me form a great habit. Thanks to #AtomicHabits a great book! You should read it!*

**What I'm going to be doing**

* Each morning I'm going to focus on documenting something that I know. It may be something that you can easily google, youtube, etc. but from my perspective I will give you examples of things I encountered when I either learned it or things that have happened while doing it. 
* I'll post them and then my goal is to create multiple types of content from them. For example, a video from a blog or a blog from a video, then I what to automate the editing of clips or short snippets from blogs to be repurposed into content. 

The challenge is I understand and know all about content strategy. I just get so locked up in my own head that I freeze in fear of the unknown. I'm tired of leading with fear. I want to lead with strength and courage so that I can help raise my daughter to be an amazing person. For that she is my motivation.
